This objective it to test if the sorted well inputs can improve the NN prediction.
Strategy:

Run 2 nnga. One with sorted well input one without. 
They both start training NN after 5 generations.
Then do NN prediction for the next 4 generations. 
NN does prediction only if the cache doesn't having it.
Cache doesn't caching new solutions at the predictions phase.
For each predicted chrosome, call PDE and calculate the MSE for the generation.
